&ensp; Gmgm peeps, it's me adlonymous again! Today, we're gonna dive into the world of Solana. This is gonna be the first part in the Intro to Solana series so, we're just gonna have a look at what Solana actually is

**Disclaimer**

&ensp; This blog series is based on the EasyA app's Solana course. Make sure to download their app and take their Solana course. You can earn NFTs and tokens for completing different modules and many more exciting features. Check them out through this [link](https://www.easya.io/)

**Not Just Any Blockchain!**

&ensp; You've heard of other blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano but Solana's different. Solana was built with speed in mind. And speed in 2 key ways: Both in terms of the blockchain itself(transactions, block times, etc), but also importantly speed of development. Another way it's different? You've heard of Proof of Work(Bitcoin) and Proof of Stake(Ethereum 2.0), but Solana uses a novel mechanism called Proof of History on Top of Proof of Stake to make validation even faster. This architecture supercharges Solana, making it capable of accomodating up to tens of thousands of transactions per seconds. Now that's FAST!

**Fast AND Effiecient**

&ensp; But don't we need to pay for speed? Some other blockchains make you pay super high fees for speed and just like a supercar going at 200 miles an hour, you might expect Solana to use tons of gas. However, here again Solana's different. It's efficient, cost-effective and secure, with low transaction fees.

**How is it so fast?**

&ensp; Solana transactions are at the speed of light because it leverages a killer combo of Proof of Stake & Proof of History instead of the energy-intensive Proof of Work (mining), making it an extremely attractive option. Sounds complicated? Don't get us wrong - Proof of History is some crazy complex tech, but it's actually pretty simple to understand the basics. Think of Proof of Stake as still being what makes it way faster. Why? Basically, because if you know the order things are meant to come in, you need to do less verifying (thus saving time)!

**Conclusion**

&ensp; This has been the first installment of the Intro to Solana series. Next up, we will have a look at Solana's token $SOL, what Solana programs are, and much more!
